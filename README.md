# Thuận An - Đồng Xoài - Phước Long Expressway
The **Thuận An - Đồng Xoài - Phước Long Expressway** (Vietnamese: **Đường cao tốc Thuận An - Đồng Xoài - Phước Long**) (Symbol for the whole route: **CT.50**, the old plan is **CT.20**) is one of the expressway projects connecting with the Central Highlands region in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The length is 117.57 km-long (73.6 miles), and roughly parallels with Provincial Road 741. It starts with the intersection of Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh in Thuan An, Di An city, and ends at the Phước Long Roundabout with Provincial Road 741 in Phước Long district (full description in "Route Description"), whereas the Phước Long City megaproject will be also planned in the future.

This expressway once completed, will shorten the travel time from Provincial Road 741 in just 50 minutes, and the route will have 32 bridges, 8 overpasses, and 12 interchanges (see below "Route Details" for full details).
## Route Description
### Section 1
The Thuận An - Đồng Xoài - Phước Long Expressway usually begins at the intersection with Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh in Thuận An city, overpassing National Route 13. Heading Northeast, the CT.50 overpasses Provincial Road 743B at the Dĩ An Viaduct, North-South Railway and Nguyễn An Ninh at the Bình An Viaduct, and National Route 1K (along the interchange). CT.50 then overpasses Mỹ Phước - Tân Vạn Road (Ho Chi Minh City Ring Road 3) (along the interchange) before turning north and crosses the Đồng Nai River at the **Đồng Nai 3 Bridge** (Vietnamese: **Cầu Đồng Nai 3**); just 2.21 km (1.37 mi) from the existing Đồng Nai Bridge, and the interchange of Đặng Văn Trơn Road. CT.50 and then crosses the Đồng Nai U-shaped River at the **Biên Hòa Bridge** (Vietnamese: **Cầu Biên Hòa**), interchanges with Phạm Văn Thuận Road, across the North-South Railway again, and the Biên Hòa Interchange of Nguyễn Ái Quốc Road. The CT.50 stops at the Thành Phú Interchange with Provincial Road 768 in Thành Phú district.
### Section 2
CT.50 continues to interchange with Biên Hòa City Ring Road, before crossing the Đồng Nai River again via the **Đồng Nai 4 Bridge** (Vietnamese: **Cầu Đồng Nai 4**) or **Tân Uyên 2 Bridge** (Vietnamese: **Cầu Tân Uyên 2**); nearly 2 km (1.24 mi) from the Tan Uyan Bridge project upstream, interchanges with Huỳnh Văn Nghệ Road, then Ho Chi Minh City Ring Road 4. The CT.50 and then turns back northeast to cross the Bé River, and interchanges with Tân Uyên - Phú Giáo - Bàu Bàng Power Road near Phước Vinh. CT.50 leaves Ho Chi Minh City Metropolitan Area before bypassing the Đồng Xoài city, as it interchanges with Provincial Road 753 (Lê Quý Đôn) and National Route 14 (via the Đồng Xoài Interchange). CT.50 passes under the overpass of an unknown named road near the Phú Riềng district (along the interchange), just before the expressway ends at the Phước Long Roundabout between with Provincial Road 741 and Thống Nhất Road in Phước Long district.
