# Thuận An - Đồng Xoài - Phước Long Expressway
The **Thuận An - Đồng Xoài - Phước Long Expressway** (Vietnamese: **Đường cao tốc Thuận An - Đồng Xoài - Phước Long**) (Symbol: **CT.20**) is one of the expressway projects connecting with the Central Highlands region in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The route is 117.57 km-long (73.6 miles), and roughly parallels with Provincial Road 741. It starts with the intersection of Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh in Thuan An, and ending at the Phước Long Roundabout with Provincial Road 741 in Phước Long district (full description in "Route Description"), whereas the Phước Long megaproject will be expanded into a city in the future.

This expressway once completed will shorten the travel time from Provincial Road 741 and have 32 bridges, 8 overpasses, and 12 interchanges (see below "Route Details" for full details).
